			"introMessage": "Although it is but your ­rst journey, the path of the Chosen Undead is a most treacherous one, by no means simple. It will take you through the ruined streets and haunted watchtowers of the Undead Burg, over the old stone bridge to Sen’s Fortress, and ­nally to the magni­cent city of Anor Londo, seat of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. This will not be an easy undertaking, and enemies will befall you at every step along the way. From your ­rst moments inside the Undead Burg, you will be assailed by ranks of hollowed soldiers and mindless zombies, and your only reward for defeating them will be to face the gargoyles that stand vigil over the next destination on your path.",
